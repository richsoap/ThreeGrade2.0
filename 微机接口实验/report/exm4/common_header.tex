% An example of a lab report write-up.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is a combination of several labs that I have done in the past for
% Computer Engineering, so it is not to be taken literally, but instead used as
% a great starting template for your own lab write up.  When creating this
% template, I tried to keep in mind all of the functions and functionality of
% LaTeX that I spent a lot of time researching and using in my lab reports and
% include them here so that it is fairly easy for students first learning LaTeX
% to jump on in and get immediate results.  However, I do assume that the
% person using this guide has already created at least a "Hello World" PDF
% document using LaTeX (which means it's installed and ready to go).
%
% My preference for developing in LaTeX is to use the LaTeX Plugin for gedit in
% Linux.  There are others for Mac and Windows as well (particularly MikTeX).
% Another excellent plugin is the Calc2LaTeX plugin for the OpenOffice suite.
% It makes it very easy to create a large table very quickly.
%
% Professors have different tastes for how they want the lab write-ups done, so
% check with the section layout for your class and create a template file for
% each class (my recommendation).
%
% Also, there is a list of common commands at the bottom of this document.  Use
% these as a quick reference.  If you'd like more, you can view the "LaTeX Cheat
% Sheet.pdf" included with this template material.
